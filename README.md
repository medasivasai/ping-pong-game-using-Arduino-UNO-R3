# ping-pong-game-using-Arduino-UNO-R3
An Autodesk Tinkercad simulation of ping pong game in an Arduino UNO development board.

This is a simulation of a ping pong game made in Tinkercad with the Arduino Uno. There are two pushbuttons for player 1 and another two for player 2. These buttons serve as the paddle.

For visual feedback, there are two LEDs in this project. If a player has won, the LED will turn green; otherwise, it will turn red. Additionally, a buzzer is connected to digital pin 10 that generates two beeps at the end of the game.

To go one step further from the project, you could implement joysticks instead of pushbuttons for the paddles.
